# TrafficSimulator
Not completely happy with the end result, but here it is.  Exported with Eclipse as a non-executable Jar, but the source code is up as well within the myProject folder. Either should be importable.

I wrote this at the end of last year, and needless to say I am fairly proud of it. I built it within eclipse, and I highly suggest
using eclipse to modify this project. The jar should contain a compiled version of the project, if one wants to use a pre-compiled version.
The UI is all text-based and fairly self-explanatory.
